# new-speed
New Speed is a Chrome extension that allows you to control the exact speed of any video, including HTML5, YouTube, Vimeo, and more. 

I built it mainly because sometimes I want 3x speed on YouTube videos, and sometimes I use other video players that don't have a speed changer in the UI.
